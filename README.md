Tasks left to do: 
- Create a tags page that allows users to filter through blog posts with the tags.
    - enable filtering by tag on a dedicated page  
    - Lists all blog posts based on a given tag.
    - All tags in the app should be links that take the user to this page.
- Make sure each single post page, has a functioning edit page  
- Document how to run tests in your README.md
- End-to-End Tests: Verify critical user flows (creating, viewing, updating blog posts, adding comments, etc.).
- Integration Tests: Cover database operations to ensure the queries work as expected.
- Consider basic protections against common exploits such as SQL injection or script injection.

BONUS (if time)
- Make a hovereffect on blogpost to indicate that it is clickable. Currently only default cursor change shows that it is clickable

- Optional Enhancements
Add login/logout features if you want to practice authentication.
Deleting blog posts and/or comments.
Better error handling: Custom HTTP status pages (404 not found etc.).
Flash: Give flash messages to users to confirm successful actions or give error messages
